1. Using you text editor, enter (that is, type in) the C++ program shown in
    Display 1.8. Be certain to type the first line exactly as shown in Display
    1.8. In particular, be sure that the first line begins at the left-hand end of
    the line with no space before or after the # symbol. Compile and run the
    program. If the compiler gives you an error message, correct the program 
    and recompile the program. Do this until the compiles give no error mes-
    sages. Then run your program.
